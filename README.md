## Customization

This project is highly customizable. Below are the main configuration files that you can modify:

### UI Customization

**File:** `configuration/ui.ts`  
Customize the chatbot's UI text and settings:

```tsx
import { AI_NAME, OWNER_NAME } from "@/configuration/identity";

export const CHAT_HEADER: string = `[CHAT HEADER]`;
